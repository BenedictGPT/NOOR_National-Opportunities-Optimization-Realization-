### Why NOOR Matters to the Ministry of Islamic Affairs

The Ministry of Islamic Affairs & Awqaf (General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments) is the **custodian of the Spiritual Faculty**, the core of a person's being, grounded in the Islamic principle of **Tazkiyah** (purification of the soul). NOOR elevates the Ministry's role from guidance and administration to providing **profound, personalized spiritual development intelligence**. This enables:

- **Deepened understanding** of the spiritual health of the nation
- **Proactive support** for individuals' spiritual journeys and practice
- **Evidence-based allocation** of Awqaf resources for maximum social impact
- **Integration of spiritual wellbeing** with the mental, emotional, and moral faculties, creating a complete human being.

### Your Faculty: Spiritual Faculty (SF)

**Islamic Anchor:** Tazkiyah (Purification of the Soul)

**Purpose:** Stewardship of faith, purpose, and connection to the divine

**What the Ministry Measures:**
- Engagement with religious practices (prayer, fasting, charity)
- Participation in Islamic education and community events
- Indicators of spiritual contentment, purpose, and meaning
- Management and impact of Awqaf (endowments)

**Why This Matters:**
The Spiritual Faculty is the compass that guides a person's life. It provides the "why" behind the "what." A strong spiritual foundation provides resilience, ethical guidance, and a sense of ultimate purpose. NOOR connects this data to all other faculties to understand the complete individual and build a society grounded in faith and values.
