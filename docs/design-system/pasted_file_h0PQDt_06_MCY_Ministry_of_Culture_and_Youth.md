- **Early identification** of high-potential talent in arts, culture, sports, and entrepreneurship.
- **Proactive cultivation** of a national mindset of ambition, perseverance, and creative courage.
- **Evidence-based cultural policy** that links cultural engagement to economic innovation and national pride.
- **Integration of individual will and drive** with educational pathways, career opportunities, and societal contribution.

### How NOOR Serves MCY's Mission

**1. Predictive Talent Identification & Nurturing**

NOOR’s AI analyzes Volitional Faculty data alongside other faculties to:
- **Identify a young artist** with high creative potential but low financial literacy (linking VF to MF).
- **Spot a potential future leader** with strong ambition but underdeveloped social skills (linking VF to SF).
- **Predict the future skills** needed in the creative economy.

**Example:**
NOOR identifies a 16-year-old who shows exceptional talent in coding competitions (Intellectual Faculty) and a high score for "initiative" and "perseverance" in their Volitional Faculty assessment. MCY can proactively offer them a scholarship to a specialized tech program and mentorship from a leading Emirati entrepreneur.

**2. Holistic Youth Development**

NOOR shows how a person's drive and ambition are linked to:
- **Education:** Aligning academic choices with personal passions.
- **Career:** Matching high-potential youth with challenging and meaningful work.
- **Wellbeing:** The link between having a purpose and overall mental and emotional health.

**This enables MCY to champion a national strategy for human potential.**

**3. Strategic Cultural Investment**

NOOR provides MCY with:
- **A map of the UAE's creative talent pool.**
- **Data on which cultural programs** have the greatest impact on youth ambition.
- **The ability to measure the ROI of cultural investment** in terms of economic innovation and social cohesion.
