### How NOOR Serves Tamkeen's Mission

**1. Hyper-Personalized Skills Development**

NOOR's 8-Faculty model allows Tamkeen to go beyond technical skills. It can create programs that develop the whole professional:
- **A brilliant engineer** (Intellectual) who also needs to be a great communicator (Social).
- **A driven entrepreneur** (Volitional) who needs the financial literacy to manage their business (Mental).
- **A compassionate healthcare worker** (Emotional) who needs the resilience to cope with stress (Physical).

**Example:**
NOOR identifies that a recent university graduate has strong technical skills but low scores in the "collaboration" and "communication" competencies of the Social Faculty. Tamkeen can proactively enroll this individual in a specialized soft-skills workshop, making them a much more attractive candidate for private sector employers.

**2. A Truly Demand-Driven Training Ecosystem**

By integrating data from employers (via EmpowerMe) with data on the available talent pool, NOOR gives Tamkeen a real-time view of the skills gap. This allows Tamkeen to:
- **Rapidly create new training programs** for emerging skills.
- **Advise the Ministry of Education** on curriculum changes needed to meet future demand.
- **Provide individuals with clear guidance** on the most valuable skills to acquire.
