### How NOOR Serves the GAS's Mission

**1. Scientific Talent Identification and Development**

NOOR allows GAS to move beyond subjective scouting to a data-driven science of talent ID. By analyzing an athlete's 8 Faculties, NOOR can:
- **Identify a young person** with the ideal physical *and* psychological profile for a specific sport.
- **Create personalized training and development plans** that address the whole athlete.
- **Predict and prevent burnout** or injury by monitoring an athlete's complete wellbeing.

**Example:**
NOOR identifies a 14-year-old with exceptional cardiovascular endurance (Physical Faculty) and high scores for perseverance and coachability (Volitional and Social Faculties). GAS can proactively recruit this individual into a national triathlon development squad, providing them with a clear pathway to elite competition.

**2. A Healthier Nation**

By analyzing community sports data alongside public health data from MOHAP, NOOR can:
- **Measure the direct impact** of sports participation on reducing chronic disease.
- **Identify geographic "cold spots"** for sports facilities and programs.
- **Tailor marketing campaigns** to encourage physical activity among different segments of the population.
