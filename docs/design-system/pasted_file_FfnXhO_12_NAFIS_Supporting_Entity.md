### How NOOR Serves the NAFIS Mission

**1. The Ultimate Matchmaking Engine**

NOOR moves beyond simple keyword matching on a CV. It allows NAFIS to match candidates based on their complete human profile:
- **Matching a company's culture** with an individual's Social and Emotional profile.
- **Matching a job's demands** for resilience and initiative with a candidate's Volitional profile.
- **Identifying hidden talent** that may not have a traditional CV but possesses the raw intellectual and mental capabilities to excel.

**Example:**
A fast-growing tech startup needs a project manager who is not only technically skilled but also highly adaptable and a great team player. NOOR allows NAFIS to search for candidates who have the right Intellectual Faculty scores, but also high scores in the "cognitive flexibility" (Mental), "collaboration" (Social), and "drive" (Volitional) competencies. This results in a much better, more successful hire.

**2. Strategic Workforce Shaping**

By having a complete view of the national talent pool and the real-time needs of the market, NOOR allows NAFIS to:
- **Advise the government** on which strategic sectors to prioritize for Emiratisation.
- **Work with universities and training providers** like Tamkeen to create programs for the jobs of tomorrow.
- **Provide citizens with clear, data-driven advice** on the most promising career paths.
